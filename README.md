## 📜 About

The **WiFi Security Tester** is a Python tool that simulates a **WiFi Deauthentication Attack**, commonly used in penetration testing to test the **security** and **resilience** of a wireless network. It sends **deauthentication packets** to disconnect devices from a WiFi network.

- **What it does**: Simulates deauthentication attacks to test if a network can withstand them.
- **Ideal for**: Ethical hackers, penetration testers, and WiFi security enthusiasts.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- **Disconnect specific devices** from the network.
- **Send deauth packets** to a targeted device or all devices on the network.
- **Customizable attack**: Select the monitor mode interface, target MAC, and access point MAC.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Linux OS** (Kali Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)
- **Python 3.x** (Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/))
- **Scapy library** (`pip install scapy`)
- **Monitor mode enabled** on a WiFi adapter
- **Aircrack-ng tools** (`sudo apt install aircrack-ng`)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install aircrack-ng
    pip install scapy
    ```

2. **Enable monitor mode on your WiFi adapter**:
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    sudo python3 deauth.py
    ```

2. **Input the following**:
    - **Monitor Mode Interface** (e.g., `wlan0mon`)
    - **AP MAC Address** (router’s MAC)
    - **Target MAC** (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` for all devices)

3. **The attack will continuously send deauth packets** to disconnect the target device(s).
